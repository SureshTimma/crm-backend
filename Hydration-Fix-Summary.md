# ðŸ”§ Hydration Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The React hydration error was caused by:
1. **localStorage access during SSR**: Our API interceptors were trying to access `localStorage` on the server
2. **Window operations during SSR**: Direct `window.location.href` calls during server-side rendering

## Root Cause
- Server-side rendering (SSR) doesn't have `localStorage` or `window` objects
- When the client hydrates, the HTML differs from server rendering
- This creates the hydration mismatch error

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Safe Utilities (`src/lib/utils.ts`)
```typescript
export const safeLocalStorage = {
  getItem: (key: string) => isBrowser ? localStorage.getItem(key) : null,
  setItem: (key: string, value: string) => isBrowser ? localStorage.setItem(key, value) : void 0,
  removeItem: (key: string) => isBrowser ? localStorage.removeItem(key) : void 0
};

export const safeWindow = {
  redirect: (url: string) => isBrowser ? window.location.href = url : void 0
};
```

### 2. Updated API Configuration (`src/lib/api.ts`)
- âœ… Safe localStorage access in request interceptors
- âœ… Safe window operations in response interceptors
- âœ… Prevents server-side localStorage errors

### 3. Updated Context and Auth Pages
- âœ… `UserContext.tsx` - Safe localStorage and window operations
- âœ… `register/page.tsx` - Safe token storage
- âœ… `login/page.tsx` - Safe token storage

## âœ… Benefits
1. **No more hydration errors** - Server and client render consistently
2. **Better error handling** - Graceful fallbacks for SSR
3. **Improved stability** - No runtime errors from missing browser APIs
4. **Cleaner code** - Centralized browser/server detection

## ðŸš€ Expected Results
- Dashboard should now load without hydration errors
- Authentication flow should work smoothly
- No more console errors about SSR mismatches
- Better user experience with consistent rendering

The hydration error should now be completely resolved!
